          The Economic and Social Council is at the heart of the United Nations system to advance the three dimensions of sustainable development – economic, social and environmental. It is the central platform for fostering debate and innovative thinking, forging consensus on ways forward, and coordinating efforts to achieve internationally agreed goals. It is also responsible for the follow-up to major UN conferences and summits.<br>
          The UN Charter established ECOSOC in 1945 as one of the six main organs of the United Nations.

            The post 2015 Development Agenda is the successor of the Millennium Development Goals, it’s a structured framework redefined by the United States and will primarily focus on the future global development framework. After the 2010 High Level Plenary Meeting of the UNGA, member states decided to accelerate progress and decided on new initiatives for post 2015. UN Secretary General BanKi Moon took several new initiatives as well. Consultations were coordinated with 88 member states facilitated by the United Nations Development Group.

            With the threat of climate change, unsustainable patterns of energy production gravely affect the planet and human health as well. Sustainable energy is an important mechanism for rural upliftment, economic growth, social progress and poverty reduction especially in particular regions of Africa and Asia. ECOSOC thereby proposes an energy sector market reformation through a range of interventions such as on policy, finance and capacity development. By encouraging investments which help in sustainable energy production and services, UN is helping to make this approach more practical and feasible. Sustainable Energy for All is an important initiative. <br><br>
