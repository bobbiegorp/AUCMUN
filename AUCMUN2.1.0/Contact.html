                Following registration, the AUCMUN Secretariat will review your application and either approve or decline it.

                Committees at AUCMUN are divided into beginner, intermediate, and advanced. For this reason you are welcome to attend even if you have little or no experience.
<br><br>                
        <b>     How do I prepare for the conference?</b><br>
                Once allocated a country to represent and a committees to debate in, you will have ample time to familiarise yourself with the topics of discussion and the ways of Model United Nations.<br>
                Study guides for the topics debated in specific committee will be made available. AUCMUN also has 
                number of more general help guides to assist delegates in their preparation. For this please see here.

        <b>     Can secondary school students attend AUCMUN?</b><br>
                AUCMUN is primarily a university-level conference. We do however accept a limited number of students from secondary schools to aid them develop more rigorous thinking. These students need to have MUN experience though.
