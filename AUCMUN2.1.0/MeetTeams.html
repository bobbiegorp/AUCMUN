            Hello everyone!
            Let us introduce; our Public Relations Team!<br>
            The aim of the PR team is to spread the word about AUCMUN and to attract a group of enthusiastic delegates. This is through actively reaching out to other schools, but also create an online platform for aspiring participants to find us.<br><br>  
            Rachelle as Head of PR keeps overview over all of the tasks of the team, keeps track of time and deadlines and her main goal is to inspire as many students as possible to join the AUCMUN event, through coordinating the other PR tasks and reaching out to other universities.<br>
            Katia is the Applications Manager, she is the one responsible for a smooth and reliable applications procedure. The event really starts from the moment students apply, so designing and keeping track of applications is very important.<br>
            Our Marketing Manager is Giovanni, he is the one to actively reach out to students, within AUC but especially outside the bubble, to inform them about AUCMUN and to get them to join and participate in this great event. He will be doing so by sending invitations out to other universities and former participants, and also by doing presentations all over the Netherlands.<br>
            Then, we have a Press Manager, Femke, who is in charge of the Facebook promotion and all tasks surrounding the social media promotion. One of these tasks is taking photos of the event, and updating on preparations. <br>
            Last but most certainly not least, there’s Bobbie, our Website Manager. His job is to coordinate the website: http://aucmun.nl/. This means creating a website and keeping it up-to-date, harmonized with the Facebook page, so people will be able to find us online and to keep track of important developments and information. 
            The Press Team is very excited for the conference, and will keep you informed on what you need to know! Hope to see you 8th and 9th of April!
