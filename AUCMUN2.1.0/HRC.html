          The Human Rights Council is an inter-governmental body within the United Nations system responsible for strengthening the promotion and protection of human rights around the globe and for addressing situations of human rights violations and make recommendations on them. It has the ability to discuss all thematic human rights issues and situations that require its attention throughout the year. It meets at the UN Office at Geneva. The Council is made up of 47 United Nations Member States which are elected by the UN General Assembly.

            While the war in Syria brews over with the incoming refugees or migrants, a growth of Xenophobia has witnessed an exponential growth. It is the fear of “foreign” people as invasive and dangerous elements in the established society. Individuals must understand the incoming population is fleeing an armed conflict or persecution. Issues of importance in this debate also regard to the misconception of Islam and the Asylum system.

                                                     <p class="font2">HUMAN RIGHTS INFRINGEMENT BY TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT AND CYBER CRIME</p>   

            The World Wide Web dominates nearly every aspect of our life. It is quite unsurprising that various activities which are criminal in nature are carried out through it. Various governments of member states such as China, Russia and United States often hack into each other’s confidential data bases which is not only immoral but also illegal. Whereas Kaspersky reports that 49 million cyber attacks took place in the first quarter of 2014 in Africa. Various issues such as a citizen’s privacy and intellectual property violations remain vague.<br><br>

          <b>Chair: Hamza Eleuij</b><br><img src="img/hrcchair.JPG"><br> <br>“My name is Hamza Eleulj, and I am excited to be your Human Rights committee co-chair for the upcoming conference. I currently study economics at City University, London. I was first introduced to MUN three years ago, in tenth grade, and the common love of a teenager to argue drew me in. I then went on to participate to 4 MUN conferences, one of which in Rome, in which I took the role of delegate in two of them, and chaired for the other two. MUN is an experience like no other, bringing together people from around the globe to sit in a room and debate issues of international importance. I am a firm believer that debate, when done right, is where the best ideas come from. I am therefore thrilled to be able to take part in the upcoming AUCMUN conference as your chair, and to hear the imaginative, intelligent ideas you all bring to the table.” <br><br>
          
          <b>Vice president: Lilya Squali</b><br><img src="img/hrcvice.JPG"><br> <br> “My name is Lilya Squali Houssaini, and I am currently studying Biomedical Sciences at the University of Warwick. It is an incredible opportunity for me to join AUCMUN as the chair of the Human Rights Council as it will be my very first time in Holland! I have been lucky enough to take part in six MUN conferences, occupying various positions from press staff to Deputy Secretary General. I will make it my primary duty to ensure delegates engage in fruitful debates and negotiate their country’s best interests with fervour, diligence, and poise. That being said, I am not against performing Eminem’s “Lose yourself” in front of my committee to break the ice and ensure you have a fun time- Yes, I did that once. On a more serious note, I hope the opposing viewpoints you will encounter throughout this conference will shed light on the challenges of diplomacy and hence encourage you to develop your confidence and leadership skills. I am truly looking forward to meeting you all!”
