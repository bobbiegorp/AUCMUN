          The Special Political and Decolonization Committee deals with a variety of subjects which include those related to decolonization, Palestinian refugees and human rights, peacekeeping, mine action, outer space, public information, atomic radiation and University for Peace.

            One of the biggest threats faced by citizens globally in the 21st century is the threat of terrorism. Counter terrorism actively deals with military techniques and strategies that government and branches of military or law use to combat the threat of terrorism. One of the most important techniques is the counter financing of terrorism which is actively used by the United States and Russia. Foreign internal defense programs are supported by member states such as USA which help other countries to battle lawlessness or insurgency. In context of counter terrorism the context of its legality and underlying response towards human rights remain important issues.

                                                     <p class="font2">THE IMPACT OF PRIVITIZATION OF WARFARE AND MILITARY</p>  

            The end of Cold War witnessed the legal establishment of Private Military Companies (PMCs) and Private Security Companies (PSCs). The biggest question is the legality of their status especially keeping in mind international law, status of PMSCs, respect for International Humanitarian Law. As the application of international law isn’t absolute this revokes an interesting debate as responsibility can be easily avoided by member states who breach it. Article 50 of ILC Articles on State Responsibility, Article 2 (4) of UN Charter are important clauses for irregular use of forces and breach of human rights. Attacks in Bangladesh in 2007, interventions of USA and Russia in other member states sovereignty are important issues resulting from this impact. <br><br>

My name is Ajatshatru Bhattacharya and I am 20 years old. I am originally from India but I have been in Netherlands for three years now for my studies. Currently, I am a second-year student doing International and European Law student at The Hague University. <br>
When I started attending MUNs I was not sure if they were for me but after attending KULMUN in Belgium I absolutely fell in love with them. So far I have done 12 MUNs and am not looking to stop anytime soon as it will be 18 by the end of May! <br>
Outside of MUNs I enjoy reading a LOT, gaming on PC or Console, graphic designing, attending music festivals and meeting new people. Recently I picked up scuba diving and I absolutely love it! I am looking forward to making the SPECPOL an amazing experience for you!”<br><br>
