                AUCMUN 2017 is around the corner and we’re expecting it to be a great one!
                From the 7th to the 9th of April students are coming in from all over the Netherlands and abroad to participate in this project and we are inviting AUC-students to host these conference guests.<br><br>
                The AUCMUN logistics team will make sure to get you and your guest in touch before the conference to discuss matters like time of arrival, potentially bringing a sleeping bag/inflatable mattress etc.
                During the weekend you will not have to worry about your guests food or social program, but are expected to make them feel welcome. <br><br>
                Are you willing to host a student? You'll receive €5 per night per person.<br><br>

                <b>Staying at AUC</b><br>
                As a student coming to visit the city of Amsterdam and take part in AUC’s MUN of 2017 you will be housed on campus with AUC’s own students. Next to having an insight into life here at AUC, you will be only 5 minutes away from most of our venues and have easy access to the train station. Additional information regarding your host and accommodation will be provided closer to the conference date as we will bring you in touch with your host.<br><br>
                <b>Travelling and Routes</b><br>
                Luckily the AUC campus is easily accessible for those coming to Amsterdam from different locations in the Netherlands or even abroad. In order to ensure that your trip to Amsterdam will run smoothly we would like to introduce you to a perfect guide to the Dutch railway system:
                www.9292.nl <br>
                By using the website or mobile application you will always know what train to take and when. Simply verify your current location, your desired destination, set a time and you are good to go. <br><br>

                Looking forward to meeting you,<br><br>
                Floortje Carlier, Housing Manager
